Hello everyone!!

I did a data science project about asset estimation of the bank customers during my experience in a bank. I fit the model with XGBoost 
algorithm which is the most popular boosting algorithm and winning many many competitions in these days through kaggle. 

I am sharing with you my codes that how I fit my XGBoost model in R by using XGBoost cross validation with Grid Search technique to 
get the best hyper params for the model like learning rate, maximum depth etc..

Hopefully, you will find some usefull codes for your projects that you will do in the future :)
